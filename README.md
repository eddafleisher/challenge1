# Horiseon - Digital Marketing Solutions

## Description

Welcome to the Horiseon Digital Marketing Solutions project! This repository contains an HTML document that showcases the services provided by Horiseon, a company specializing in digital marketing. My task was to refactor the Horiseon's existing site to make it more accessible. I followed the accessibility standards and I present an improved version of the site. Had some challenges with the css, but then I worked it out.
